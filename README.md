# 🧑‍💻 Valentine Agaba – Portfolio Website

This is my personal developer portfolio showcasing selected web development projects, skills, and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and contact details.

The site was designed and built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a touch of Bootstrap, with a clean layout and mobile responsiveness. It highlights both frontend and backend experience, tailored for employers and collaborators.
